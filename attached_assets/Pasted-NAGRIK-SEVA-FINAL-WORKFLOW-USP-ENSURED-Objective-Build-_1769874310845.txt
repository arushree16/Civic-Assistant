NAGRIK SEVA — FINAL WORKFLOW (USP-ENSURED)

Objective:
Build a working web prototype that is better than ticket-based civic apps by ensuring visibility, guidance, memory, and collective context.

🟢 GLOBAL DATA STRUCTURE (FOUNDATION)

Maintain a global state:

issues[] = [{
  id,
  issueType,
  description,
  area,
  status,              // Reported → Forwarded → In Progress → Resolved
  daysUnresolved,
  peopleAffected,
  createdAt
}]


This single structure powers ALL USPs.

🔵 SCREEN 1: CHAT / ISSUE INPUT
User Action

User types:

“Garbage hasn’t been picked up near my house for 3 days”

System Action

Keyword-based classification → Waste
